# Architecture

## Dependency direction

```
app (pages, server actions)  →  domain services  →  db (drizzle + SQL)
        ↑                            ↑
   auth context / policy       queue · observability · flags
```

The browser never owns financial state. Pages render from services; mutations run through
server actions that call the same services. Services enforce authorization, currency, and
lifecycle rules; database constraints are the last line of defense.

## Data model highlights

- **Family** is the tenant boundary. Every query path filters through it; cross-family access
  is denied at service level with negative tests.
- **Account** has a type (`depository`, `credit_card`, `other_asset`, `other_liability`),
  lifecycle status, optional owner, and report inclusion flag.
  - Owner set → other members need an explicit share (`full_control` / `read_write` /
    `read_only`). Owner null → joint account, full control for all family members.
- **Entry** is the ledger row: date, signed `amount_minor`, currency, name, typed entryable
  (`transaction` or `valuation`), optional parent link for splits, and optional external id
  with a partial unique index for import-safe idempotency.
- **Sign convention** matches the source project: outflow entries are positive, inflow
  negative. Display balance = opening anchor − Σ(entry amounts). UI negates for presentation.
- **Transfer** joins exactly two transaction legs in different accounts of one family with
  opposing amounts within ±4 days; creation/removal is atomic and retry-safe.
- **Split** children must sum to the parent amount and inherit its date/account/currency;
  balance math counts leaves only (`parent_entry_id IS NULL`).
- **Balances** are materialized daily snapshots recomputed on writes (forward from earliest
  affected date) and nightly by the worker. Valuation-driven accounts track latest valuation.
- **Exchange rates** are dated pairs; conversions use latest rate ≤ date with inverse fallback;
  missing rates exclude amounts from converted totals and raise a support-visible diagnostic.

## Queue semantics

Jobs live in a `jobs` table with attempts/max/backoff/dedupe/dead-letter states. The worker
claims batches with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, recovers stale locks, runs cron schedules from
`cron_schedules`, and records failures both in-row and in `debug_log_entries`. Email delivery,
nightly balance maintenance, and retention cleanup ship as the initial job set.

## Observability

Structured pino logs with action names/timings, redaction of sensitive keys, an audit trail
(`audit_events`) for auth/sharing/ledger/lifecycle events, and a super-admin diagnostics page
surfacing `debug_log_entries` plus queue health.

## Deliberate exclusions

See DECISIONS.md — bank providers, investments, budgets/goals, AI, shared expenses, CSV
import, MFA/passkeys, and public API are intentionally absent from this release scope.
