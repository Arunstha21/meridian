# Decisions

Recorded per the clone plan's requirement that scope and technology decisions precede
implementation. Source baseline: Sure `c44408ff` (dev-upstream-sync), reviewed 2026-08-12.

## Scope (launch)

| Module | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity/sessions | Keep | Email/password + verification; MFA/SSO deferred |
| Families, sharing | Keep | Family tenancy from day one; 3-level share permissions |
| Manual accounts | Keep | depository, credit_card, other_asset, other_liability only |
| Ledger/transfers/splits/valuations | Keep | Full invariants; transfer fees deferred |
| Categories/tags | Keep | Merchant is a plain string; normalization deferred |
| Reports/dashboard | Keep | Net worth, income vs expense, spending by category |
| Budgets/goals/rules/recurring | Remove/Defer | Re-add with dedicated design after ledger stabilizes |
| Investments, crypto, providers, AI, shared expenses, imports | Remove/Defer | Per removal-catalog recommended cuts |
| Export | Keep | JSON family export for portability (non-negotiable privacy item) |
| Public API / mobile / desktop / PWA | Remove | No compatibility promises |

## Technology

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Money storage | bigint minor units + ISO currency | Exact fixed point; safe-integer bound documented |
| Sign convention | Source convention preserved (outflow +) | Keeps upstream behavior ports mappable |
| Migrations | Hand-reviewed SQL with paired down-scripts | Auditable schema evolution; rehearsed up/down in CI |
| Auth | In-house scrypt/session layer | Small auditable surface over finance authorization |
| Queue | Custom Postgres queue | Durable, retry/dead-letter/cron semantics without Redis; exit path to pg-boss/graphile if scale demands |
| FX fallback | Exclude + diagnostic on missing rate | Never silently wrong totals |
| Opening balances | Explicit columns (display-signed) instead of anchor valuations | Simpler model for the four launched account types; deviation recorded |

## Resolved ambiguities

- Transfer date window: ±4 calendar days (constant).
- Cross-currency transfers: rejected at launch.
- Splitting transfer legs: forbidden until unlink.
- Draft accounts: creatable but excluded from reports until activated; closed accounts reject
  mutations but retain history.
- Privacy mode: server-rendered masking via preference; nothing sensitive cached client-side.

## Follow-ups (explicit deferrals)

1. CSV import built atop the external-id dedupe index.
2. Transfer fees as a third linked transaction.
3. MFA/passkeys before any managed/public launch.
4. Versioned REST API behind explicit contract ownership.
5. Provider framework: connection + credentials + idempotent sync as one unit, no partial connectors.
